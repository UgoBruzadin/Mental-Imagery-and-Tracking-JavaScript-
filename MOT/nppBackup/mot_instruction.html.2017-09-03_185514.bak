<center><h1>Instructions: Multi Object Tracking</h1>

<b> This is a test of your ability to track many objects at once. 
<br> The objective is to track the objects that blink.
<br> Circles will blink three (3) times, and then start moving in random directions.
<br> Once all objects stop moving, you have 10 seconds to click on the objects that blinked.
<br><br> If after ten seconds you haven't clicked in any objects, another trial will start.
<br> If you miss three trials, this experiment will be terminated. 

<br><br>First, there will be a training session. 
<br> During the training session, you'll practice tracking two circles. 
<br> After three training trials, you will be redirected to the task.
<br> Good luck!
