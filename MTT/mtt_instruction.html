<center><h1>Instructions: Manual Tracking Task</h1>

<b> This is a test of your ability to track a circle with your mouse. 
<br> Four (4) targets will show on the screen for 3 seconds.
<br> When targets are gone, one circle will show on the right OR on the left of the screen.
<br> The circle will zig-zag, bouncing from where the 4 targets were.
<br> Your objective is to track the movement of the circle with the mouse as best as you can.
<br><br> On half the trials, a gray rectangle will cover the center of the screen.
<br> 
<br> Do not use your hands or fingers to help. 
<br> This is a memory task.
<br> Use only the mouse pointer to track the circle.
<br>
<br> If you don't move your mouse too much, the trial will be considered a "miss".
<br> If you miss three trials, this experiment will be terminated. 

<br><br>First, there will be a training session. Get used to the size of the circle.
<br> Your objective is to keep the mouse as close to the center of the circle as possible.
<br>
<br> When you're ready to start, click "Start Training"
<br><input class="next" id="next" type="button" value="Start Training" onclick="nextTrialIf()"></input>
