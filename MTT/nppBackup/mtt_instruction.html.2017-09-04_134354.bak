<center><h1>Instructions: Manual Tracking Task</h1>

<b> This is a test of your ability to track a circle with your mouse. 
<br> Four (4) targets will show on the screen for 3 seconds.
<br> When targets are gone, one circle will show on the right OR on the left of the screen.
<br> The circle will zig-zag, bouncing from where the 4 targets were.
<br> Your objective is to track the movement of the circle with the mouse as best as you can.
<br><br> On half the trials, a gray rectangle will cover the center of the screen.
<br> 
<br> If you don't move your mouse too much, the trial will be considered a "miss".
<br> If you miss three trials, this experiment will be terminated. 

<br><br>First, there will be a training session.
